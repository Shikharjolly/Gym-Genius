# Gym-Genius
A simple and gimmick free way to workout!
The only bad workout is one that did not happen


## Sign-Up / Login
This webapp will allow users to create a profile through which they will be able to track their fitness goals, as well as find and book events near them. Once an account is created, the user is directed to a login page. After putting in their information, they are led to a profile page.

## Profile
This Profile page has two parts:

Part 1 - This is used to document workouts to optimize which parts of the body need more or less focus

Part 2- This part is used to find and book events. All events available will be listed here. On the top-right of each event, there is a book event button. Once booked and RSVP'ed, you get charged $10 per event every time you book a ticket/spot. To checkout and play you balance, you click checkout to go the checkout page. The checkout page is very simple and straightforward.

This Profile page will also be the first time users have access to the navbar, which consists of three links: Home, Profile, Events. We already covered the Profile Page, so lets cover the other two. Lets start with Home.

## Home
This is more like an about page, showcasing not only the types of events, but the events themselves. Scrolling to the bottom will show the events we currently have available. The "Get Started" button in the header will simply take you to the Profile Page.

## Event
This is where users can apply simple CRUD operations to events. Users will be able to create, edit and delete events.
